            Why..
        </div>
        <div class="why-paragraph">
            <p>I want to visit Paris, France because of its <b><i>timeless elegance, rich history, and artistic treasures</i></b>. While the Eiffel Tower is undoubtedly the most hyped landmark, my fascination with Paris goes beyond that. I've always been intrigued by the city's deep connection to art, especially the Louvre Museum, which houses some of the most famous paintings in the world. Seeing masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo in person would be a dream come true.</p>
            <p>I've also heard that French people can be quite intimidating, which only adds to my curiosity about their culture and way of life. Paris is also known for its exquisite pastries, and I can't wait to indulge in authentic croissants, macarons, and other delicious treats. As the "City of Love," it has a romantic charm that makes me hope I can visit one day with someone special. Hopefully, when that time comes, I’ll get to experience Paris in all its beauty, culture, and charm.
