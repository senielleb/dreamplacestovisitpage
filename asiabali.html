            Why..
        </div>
        <div class="why-paragraph">
            <p>I want to visit Bali, Indonesia because of its <b><i>stunning beaches, rich culture, and breathtaking landscapes</i></b>. Known for its picturesque temples, lush rice terraces, and vibrant beach life, Bali offers a perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. What makes this trip even more meaningful is that my mother also dreams of going there, and I would love to experience it with her.</p>
            <p>I’ve heard that Bali shares similarities with the Philippines, from its tropical beauty to its warm and welcoming people, but with a different language and unique cultural influences. That makes me even more curious to explore its traditions, local way of life, and distinct charm. Since I grew up loving the beach, I also want to experience one that’s farther from home, discovering what makes Bali’s shores and island atmosphere truly special.</p>
