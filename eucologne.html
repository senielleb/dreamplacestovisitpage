            Why..

        <div class="why-paragraph">
            <p>I want to visit Cologne, Germany because of its rich history, stunning architecture, and deep religious significance. My mother, being very religious, has always wanted to visit, and I would love to take her there one day. The city is home to magnificent churches, especially the famous Cologne Cathedral, a breathtaking Gothic masterpiece that stands as one of the most iconic landmarks in Europe.</p>
            <p>Aside from its religious and historical charm, Cologne holds a special place in my heart because it was a filming location for one of my favorite K-dramas. Seeing the beautiful streets and landmarks in person after watching them on screen would make the experience even more exciting. Visiting Cologne would be a meaningful journey, both for my mother and for my own love of history, culture, and film.</p>
