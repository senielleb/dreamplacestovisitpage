            Why..
        </div>
        <div class="why-paragraph">
            <p>I want to visit Tokyo, Japan because of its <b><i>unique blend of tradition and modernity</i></b> where ancient temples stand alongside futuristic skyscrapers. As a big fan of anime and Japanese movies, I’ve always been fascinated by how Japan’s culture is portrayed in the media, and I want to experience it firsthand. Beyond my love for anime, I’m deeply curious about their way of life, traditions, and the overall atmosphere of the city.</p>
            <p>Japan is also known for its deep appreciation of matcha, and as someone who enjoys it, I can't pass up the chance to taste authentic matcha desserts and drinks straight from the source. But more than just one of my personal interests, I want to visit Tokyo to immerse myself in its culture and environment. Whether it's exploring the neon-lit streets of Shibuya, visiting historic temples, or experiencing the tranquility of a Japanese garden, I know Tokyo has so much to offer beyond what I’ve seen on screen. I also want to see the beautiful sakura trees in full bloom and try their famous mochis, experiencing the seasonal charm and flavors that make Japan even more special.</p>
